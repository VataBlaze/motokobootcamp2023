Q1: How much is the current memory capacity of a canister?

A1: 48 GB

Q2: What is the issue with the following code sample?

A2: It's attempting to reassign to an immutable variable. 

actor { var counter : Nat = 0; public func increment_counter() : async () { counter := counter + 1; }; }

Q3: What is the issue with the following code sample?

A3: Cannot assign a Nat to var type Text. 

actor { var message : Text = "";
public query func change_message(new_message : Text) : async () { message := new_message; return; };
public query func see_message() : async Text { return(message); }; }

Q4: False or True: we can remove the keyword async for return argument of a query function since queries are faster to answer.

A4: False
